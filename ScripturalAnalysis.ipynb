      "Behold O ye my people or my brethren for I esteem you as such I desire that ye should consider the cause which ye are called consider for ye are desirous have king\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I declare unto you that he whom the kingdom doth rightly belong has declined will not take upon him the kingdom\n",
      "\n",
      "And now if there should be another appointed in his stead behold I fear there would rise contentions among you And who know but what my son whom the kingdom doth belong should turn be angry draw away part this people after him which would cause wars contentions among you which would be the cause shedding much blood perverting the way the Lord yea destroy the souls many people\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I say unto you let us be wise consider these things for we have no right destroy my son neither should we have any right destroy another if he should be appointed in his stead\n",
      "\n",
      "And if my son should turn again his pride vain things he would recall the things which he had said claim his right the kingdom which would cause him also this people commit much sin\n",

      "Now it is better that man should be judged God than man for the judgments God are always just but the judgments man are not always just\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore if it were possible that you could have just men be your kings who would establish the laws God judge this people according his commandments yea if ye could have men for your kings who would do even as my father Benjamin did for this people I say unto you if this could always be the case then it would be expedient that ye should always have kings rule over you\n",

      "For behold how much iniquity doth one wicked king cause be committed yea what great destruction\n",
      "\n",
      "Yea remember king Noah his wickedness his abominations also the wickedness abominations his people Behold what great destruction did come upon them also because their iniquities they were brought into bondage\n",

      "\n",
      "And now behold I say unto you it is not expedient that such abominations should come upon you\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore choose you by the voice this people judges that ye may be judged according the laws which have been given you by our fathers which are correct which were given them by the hand the Lord\n",
      "\n",
      "Now it is not common that the voice the people desir anything contrary that which is right but it is common for the lesser part the people desire that which is not right therefore this shall ye observe make it your law do your business by the voice the people\n",

      "\n",
      "And many more things did king Mosiah write unto them unfolding unto them all the trials troubles righteous king yea all the travails soul for their people also all the murmurings the people their king he explained it all unto them\n",
